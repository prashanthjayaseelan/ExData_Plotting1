## Description of the script & output files for this assignment:

Following are the R script & output files:

a) Plot1.r  - This creates a historgram (PNG image) that shows the "Global active power" in kilowatts in x axis and Frequency in y axis.

b) Plot1.png - Output of Plot1.r

c) Plot2.r  - This creates a plot with the days in x axis and Global active power in y axis.

d) Plot2.png  - Output of Plot2.r

e) Plot3.r  - This creates a plot shows the sub meter 1, sub meter 2 and sub meter 3 along with the legend.

f) Plot3.png  - Output of Plot3.r

g) Plot4.r  - This shows multiple plots i.e. output of plot1, plot2, plot 3 & a plot on "Global Reactive Power" in a 2 x 2 format.

h) Plot4.png  - Output of Plot4.r

## Source dataset and the variables used for this assignment:

The "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" which is available on the course web site:
* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.


The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken
from
the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">UCI
web site</a>:

<ol>
<li><b>Date</b>: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </li>
<li><b>Time</b>: time in format hh:mm:ss </li>
<li><b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </li>
<li><b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_1</b>: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_2</b>: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_3</b>: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.</li>
</ol>
